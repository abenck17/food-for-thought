# Food For Thought

Food For Thought was built for a community of individuals who want to make a change to their diet plan, or a macro tracking community, where users will be able to track the  macros of their favorite recipes based on their goals, and add recipes for other users to try. This will include a signUp/logIn page with encrypted passwords to keep the user safe, an All Recipes page that documents all of the recipes added by users, and a profile page to see your recipes and information.

# Issues / Missed opertunities

- Understand which user is creating a new recipe and pre-populate the userId field
- Remember a user and be able to access the user's profile once logged, without requiring to log in again
- Create a filter on the All Recipes page to filter by favorite, date created, name, calorie, fat, carb, or protein
- Show the password on the user profile without the hash encrypt, allowing the user to edit the password
- Ran into problems with my deployed Heroku sight
  - Getting timeout errors, explained as requests taking longer than 30 seconds 
  - Decided to present locally
