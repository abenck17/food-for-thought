# Food For Thought

Food For Thought was built for a community of individuals who want to make a change to their diet plan, or a macro tracking community, where users will be able to track the  macros of their favorite recipes based on their goals, and add recipes for other users to try. This will include a signUp/logIn page with encrypted passwords to keep the user safe, an All Recipes page that documents all of the recipes added by users, and a profile page to see your recipes and information.
